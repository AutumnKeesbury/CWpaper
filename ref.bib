	abstract = {The most common historiographical narrative used to explain the
	            transformation of American medicine during the Civil War
	            centralizes on the brilliance of a few notable physicians, whose
	            radical ideas, daring, and exceptional work ethic built or set
	            precedents for standards foundational to modern medicine. However,
	            this approach is limited and does not consider the impact of the
	            context of war and power structures in shaping the practice of
	            medicine. Through examining personal accounts and official
	            documentation including, government reports, news articles, war
	            journals, private and military correspondence, physicians and
	            nurse’s notes, and post-war autobiographical recollections, a new
	            understanding emerges. Civil War physicians were mobilized to make
	            medical breakthroughs due to the context of war itself. The demands
	            of battlefield medicine coupled with the unprecedented magnitude of
	            the wounded exacerbated and made unavoidably explicit many
	            dysfunctional norms and commonly held practices in treatment or
	            inpatient care that too often characterized early American
	            medicine. The context of war exposed the need for changes in
	            medical practice, which was consequently made possible by the
	            military’s centralized authority, resources, and systems. These two
	            factors prompted Civil War physicians to transform and
	            professionalize medicine by establishing and enforcing standards
	            for inpatient care procedures or training requirements for
	            practitioners. Ultimately, without the circumstance of battle or
	            the power structure of the military at war, the changes that
	            improved medical practice would have happened much more
	            incrementally and over a more extended period.},
